# PickASpot_Smart_Parking_System
A smart parking system shows real-time slot availability, supports online booking, smart card payments, and safety features like fire detection. It reduces traffic, pollution, and accidents, while allowing pre-booking at malls and limited-time slot reservations for better convenience.

## Abstract

As the automobile industry becomes an integral part of modern life, the increasing demand for vehicles has led to a significant shortage of parking spaces, especially in urban areas. Due to todayâ€™s busy lifestyle, automation is essential for remotely checking the availability of parking spots to help reduce pollution and traffic congestion.

This system proposes a smart parking solution where various parking areas are enrolled into a centralized system. Each parking entity will continuously update data regarding empty slots. An interactive blueprint map will be displayed both on the website and at the entrance of the parking premises, allowing users to view available spots in real time.

The system enables users to reserve a secure parking slot for their vehicle, reducing time spent searching for parking. Additional features in high-traffic areas like malls include:

- Pre-booking at restaurants or hotels
- Time-limited parking reservations (slots become available again after the reserved time)
- Fire detection within the premises

A "Pay and Park" concept is integrated using a smart card. Users can request a card through the system and receive it via delivery. This solution aims to minimize time waste, pollution, vehicle roaming, and accidents caused by improper parking.

## Purpose of Project

- To resolve issues like wastage of time and fuel.
- To prevent unnecessary roaming of vehicles around parking spaces.
- To reduce the rate of accidents caused by improper parking.
- To provide easy and remote access to parking areas enrolled in the system.

## Scope of Project

- A smart parking system based on slot booking and remote viewing of parking areas, implemented using a Python-based website.
- Enables users to book their own parking slots using a slot allocation method.
- Provides an efficient solution to parking problems by reducing waiting times and long queues.
- Increases the overall efficiency of the parking system.
- Can be extended to a fully automated system for multilayer parking structures, allowing users to manage parking through handheld devices.
- Includes safety measures such as fire alarms and an automatic billing process.
- Implements a pay-and-park system via smart cards to allow cashless transactions.
